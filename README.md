> assert certain conditions, if not true, give an error

This is a assertion library which is built for [goboscript](https://github.com/aspizu/goboscript).
 It is based on [the stdlib implementation](https://github.com/goboscript/std/), but it is designed to be used with [inflator](https://github.com/faretek1/inflator).

## Credits
